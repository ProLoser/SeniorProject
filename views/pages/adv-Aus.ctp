        <h3>Volunteer</h3>
        <p class="about">In the last 200 years, Australia has lost many of its iconic species and has one of the worst mammal extinction rates in the world. As a volunteer, you have the opportunity to work alongside local Australian organizations that have partnered with ISV to develop hands-on conservation Volunteer Projects.</p>

                <img src="img/volunteer/australia/aus-vol01.jpg" alt="<strong>Nature Sanctuary:</strong> <em>Make a difference to Australia's wildlife!</em><br />
ISV has several projects located in nature sanctuaries. The goal is to conserve native animals in a relatively natural setting. Primary tasks vary and can include building and maintaining animal enclosures, fence building, vegetation removal, tree planting, and surveying. All of these tasks are directly related to the establishment or maintenance of the sanctuary and the species within it." />

                <img src="img/volunteer/australia/aus-vol02.jpg" alt="<strong>Habitat Restoration:</strong> <em>Volunteer in unique Australian landscapes!</em><br /> 
ISV is dedicated to assisting with numerous habitat restoration projects throughout Australia on public and privately owned land. Get ready to get your hands dirty and see the results of your efforts by helping to rehabilitate land. The goal of these projects is to help restore important habitats through native revegetation (planting) and exotic species removal. Tasks may also focus on specific issues such as soil erosion and salinity." />

Be part of important research that is critical to the success of conservation management plans. ISV has been involved in both baseline surveys and long-term studies. The primary goal of this type of project is to obtain data that will be used to assist with conservation of species and ecosystems. Primary tasks include surveying and monitoring (such as measuring size, age and abundance of plants and animals), experimental set-up, and other data collection." />

Get involved to help develop or operate existing outdoor education facilities that teach others about sustainability. The goal of these projects is to facilitate understanding and appreciation of the natural world and the importance of taking care of it. Opportunities exist for volunteers to be involved in facilities design and development. Other volunteer tasks vary by project and can include weeding, planting, light construction, nature trail building and property maintenance." />
